          Glimpse is a creative collective where like-minded electronic music enthusiasts can collaborate. Whether playing in a club/live environment or as a vehicle to realise solo/collaborative music projects through the Glimpse Recordings label. Glimpse's productions and sets are generally considered 'techno,' but they have never been afraid to venture into the deeper ends of electro, dub techno, and house.

          Notable highlights include tracks championed by leading techno exponents such as Richie Hawtin, Magda, and Laurent Garnier, to name a few. This exposure has led to DJ gigs across the UK and Europe, including Stanton Calling Festival (UK), MOS (London), Watergate (Berlin), Harry Klein (Munich), and The Rex Club (Paris). The ethos has always remained the sameâ€”make everything about the music and let the music speak for itself. Do not fixate on the individuals behind the sound; that's simply an unwanted distraction.
